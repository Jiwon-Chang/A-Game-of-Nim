# A-Game-of-Nim
A game of Nim with an interesting winning strategy. Playable in both Player vs Player mode and Player vs Computer mode.

I recently started learning C++, and this is my first ever "big" project I coded using C++.
It took me a total of three days to make the game.

Enjoy!

*Note: You will have figured out the winning strategy once you have beaten the computer on "smart" mode.
